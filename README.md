# dasharr
DashArr is a unified dashboard. It consolidates Radarr, Sonarr, Readarr, Prowlarr, and others into a single UI and API, providing unified search, queues, and calendar views. The project is built with TypeScript on both the API and web, and is designed for self-hosters who want a clean, fast, all-in-one control surface for their media stack.
